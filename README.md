# DCI-UG-Direct-Laser-Writing-Codes
This repository contains the Python and Arduino codes for controlling a 3D optomechatronic platform used to develop different 
microstructures through Direct Laser Writing, using a photoresist. It also contains calculations for 
determining the intensity distribution of the electric field of a focused laser.
